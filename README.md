# Natural_Language_Processing-SkimLit
Welcome to Natural Language Processing (NLP) project, implemented using TensorFlow.

This project is based on the research presented in the following paper:

**Title:** a Dataset for Sequential Sentence Classification in Medical Abstracts

**Authors:** Franck Dernoncourt, Ji Young Lee

**Published in:** PubMed

**Year:** 2017

## Overview

Natural_Language_Processing-SkimLit is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that uses the power of TensorFlow and Google Colab with GPU support to assist researchers and readers in summarizing and categorizing academic papers. The project is designed to automate the process of extracting and categorizing abstract sentences into five predefined categories: METHODS, RESULTS, CONCLUSIONS, BACKGROUND, and OBJECTIVE. This tool is incredibly useful for anyone looking to quickly grasp the core concepts of an academic paper.

## Key Features

Abstract Sentence Classification: Automatically classify sentences in the paper's abstract into relevant categories.
GPU Acceleration: Utilizes Google Colab's GPU support for faster model training.
TensorFlow-Based: Built using TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework.
User-Friendly: Easy-to-use tool for researchers and readers to extract key information from academic papers.
Customization: You can fine-tune the model to adapt to specific research domains or writing styles.

## How It Works

Input Abstract: Provide the abstract of the academic paper.
Sentence Classification: SkimLit's model will classify each sentence in the abstract into one of the five categories: METHODS, RESULTS, CONCLUSIONS, BACKGROUND, or OBJECTIVE.
Retrieve Insights: Instantly access a summarized version of the paper's abstract with categorized sentences.
